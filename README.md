Example of using OBD-II diagnostic port in car to read RPM and control Max/MSP engine simulation

Instructions:

in Max add the automax folder to your file preferences.
load the patch: automax.maxpat

At this point you can play the engine sounds - if you have an ELM-327 bluetooth OBD-II device, you should be able to get it to read RPM from your car
